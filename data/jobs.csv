In the process of establishing a new business relationship, knowing the customer is of key importance to ING. This is necessary to minimize the possibility of ING becoming a party to money laundering or terrorist financing activities.

ING therefore attaches paramount importance to upholding its reputation by observing national and international FEC requirements.

 Information, documentation gathering and record retention of the evidence

 Initiation of the CDD process and follow up, review of due dates.

 Follow *MiFID, Alert Hit handling and PTM procedures and working instructions

 Client file processing in the relevant ING systems such as CDD and MiFID Tool

 Processing of new CDD/MiFID requests, CDD/MiFID changes and periodic reviews

 Analyse, investigate and decide on the unusual alerts generated by ERASE system

Role: Data Analyst as part of Opna's Early-Career Climate Talent Program

Reporting to: Business Development Team

Environment: Remote

Compensation: Market Benchmark Contractual Rate (this will be adjusted for your location)

Type of Employment: 3-6 month contract

Other: We cannot sponsor visas at this time

We have purposefully kept this role as remote as we want to encourage early-career talent, anywhere in the world, to apply -The only bar here is relevant experience, expertise, and whether you can work in a scrappy/execution-first mode for a startup.

Requirements

Opna’s Vision

Imagine a thriving, equitable planet where everyone actively participates and benefits from building projects that contribute to a low-carbon economy, safeguarding our environment, and combating climate change. At Opna, we want to make this vision a reality - by unlocking the needed capital for every high-quality climate project that addresses climate change with speed, scale, and equity.

Urgent Challenge

We stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change. We must rapidly undo the centuries-long impact of fossil fuels. This demands an unprecedented infrastructure revolution - we must rapidly scale high-quality climate projects that remove and reduce carbon dioxide from our atmosphere. High-quality carbon removal projects, from afforestation to biochar, to newer/frontier technologies encounter formidable barriers in accessing necessary financing - that’s where Opna comes in. We’re combining data, financing innovation, and technology to help high-quality climate projects access right timed, right sized financing, anywhere in the world.

Our Solution

Opna offers a software platform for climate-action-committed companies to finance and manage high-quality carbon projects in a standardised, transparent, and cost effective way.

The world’s leading climate-action committed companies are moving away from simply buying carbon credits, to directly financing carbon projects. Thousands of other companies, big and small must follow suit, but simply do not have the inhouse resources, expertise, or large budgets to contract with projects in a cost-effective, transparent, and knowledgeable way.

Opna’s software allows companies to discover a wide range of high-quality carbon projects, understand their risk and impact using Opna’s proprietary risk-assessment engine, finance projects using standardised tools and finally, monitor and report on projects’ post financing.

We’re making carbon projects financing more accessible, cheaper and 100% transparent, enabling companies big and small to take credible climate action. This also helps solve the massive project financing gap and brings net-new supply of high quality carbon projects to the market.

Our Team

We are HQ’ed in London but also have team members in Berlin and Barcelona. Collectively we have deep experience and expertise across capital markets, carbon markets, startups climate finance, and FinTech. We hold each other accountable and give regular and open communication. We share our optimism for finding solutions to climate change. We’re gritty and actively practise empathy. We are serious about our work, but don’t take ourselves too seriously!

You want to, and are comfortable working in an early stage environment, where your role may stretch beyond the responsibilities of this role and your day-to-day will involve rapid changes and associated chaos.
